                          On all our safaris we make use of specially designed and converted Toyota Landcruisers. We have put a lot of thought into adapting them to the rugged African bush, the rough conditions, and the bumpy roads, providing maximum comfort and at the same time ensuring the best safari experience for our guests. Our safari vehicles have large sliding windows and <strong>pop-up roofs</strong>, offering excellent views and giving our guests fantastic opportunities for safe and undisturbed photography while on game drives. The passenger compartment is equipped with six individual and comfortable seats guaranteeing a window seat for each guest. In addition, a seventh seat is available next to the guide. All our vehicles are fitted with a safari fridge, powered by the car battery, for keeping your drinks cold and refreshing. 220&nbsp;Volt electric sockets&nbsp;for battery chargers ensure that you won&rsquo;t miss capturing any of the special moments you will experience on your safari. The powerful engines allow the vehicles to manage various kinds of terrain without any difficulties even when traveling on roads that are off the beaten track. Regular services on the motors are essential to ensure continued reliability. Your safety is our priority. All our guides only drive their &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo; safari vehicle. This results in optimized maintenance, handling, and caretaking of our fleet on the one hand and safe and secure driving due to being familiar with the specific Landcruiser on the other hand. As there is limited space available in the luggage compartment, we ask all our guests to restrict their luggage to 15 kg in weight. Luggage that won&rsquo;t be needed on safari can be stored in our office or in the Hotel Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances or during the peak of high season <strong>Toyota Landcruiser Hire</strong> reserves the right to make use of <strong>rental vehicles</strong> that are similar, but may not have the exact same equipment that is found in our specialized vehicles.

The most important aspect of a safari with us the unforgettable experience with our professional Driver Guides. You will spend a lot of time with them and therefore it is essential that they get on well with you. Our driver guides are all handpicked and are very friendly, cheerful, experienced, and knowledgeable about the parks and animals. We would like to think of it in terms of them adopting you as their family for the time they are with you. (We can forward you copies of questionnaires filled by our previous clients, shall you wish). While on Safari, every morning our Safari Vehicles will be presented clean (inside and outside) and ready for the days adventure for our guests. Our Safaris and Game Drives are a photographer&rsquo;s delight! Guest comfort and convenience has always been a top most priority at <strong>land cruiser hire</strong> and this is reflected in what travelers experience at the start of our journey with us&hellip; Our sturdy, latest and impressive fleet of vehicles<strong>. </strong>We own 40 Toyota Land Cruiser 4&times;4 Extended Safari cars, coasters and luggage vehicles positioned in Arusha for our Northern Circuit wildlife adventure. Our headquarters in Dar es Salaam, boost of 20 airport ground transfer saloon and mini buses with free Wi-Fi access for city transfers, 6 Safari Cars (Land Rovers/ Toyota Land Cruisers) for the Southern Circuit and 1 Coaster (20-seater). The <strong>Kenya and Tanzania safaris</strong> that we run are personalized and exclusive without being overly priced. This means that when you are on <strong>Kenya and Tasmania safari</strong> with us you get a 4&times;4 vehicle which is for your exclusive use only. This has the advantage that your <strong>Tanzania and Kenya safaris </strong>will be far more flexible in terms of times of departure etc. Times can be agreed between you and the driver guide on a daily basis. It also means that on a full day game drive you may want to return to the lodge for lunch instead of taking a packed lunch or you may feel tired on a particular day and want to return to the lodge to relax and enjoy a cool drink by the pool, or stay at a particular area where there is a specific animal that you would like to view for an hour or more. This is possible on our safaris as it will be you and you only in the vehicle.

                        <li>The higher seating in a Jeep creates better visibility to view and photograph wildlife</li>
                        <li>Off-road Jeeps go where other vehicles fear to tread &ndash; head deeper into the bush and easily go off-road to pursue that elusive leopard</li>
                        <li>The Jeep&rsquo;s special suspension offers a more comfortable ride on rough ground.</li>
                        <li>The Jeep is built and customized for the demands of an African safari adventure &ndash; more doors for easy access, 2 fuel tanks and two spare tires</li>
                        <li>More roomy and stable than a safari minivan</li>
                        <li>The Jeep&rsquo;s pop up top ensures an unobstructed 360 degree views</li>
                        <li>You&rsquo;ll be journeying to and traversing the African landscape in the ultimate safari vehicle as adventurers have for over 70 years.</li>
